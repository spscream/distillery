## Configuration

Looking for how to handle configuration of your app when using releases?
Check out [Runtime Configuration](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/runtime-configuration.html).

Below is a brief overview of the release configuration file format:

```elixir
use Mix.Releases.Config,
    # This sets the default release built by `mix release`
    default_release: :default,
    # This sets the default environment used by `mix release`
    default_environment: :dev

# You may define one or more environments in this file,
# an environment's settings will override those of a release
# when building in that environment, this combination of release
# and environment configuration is called a profile
environment :dev do
  set dev_mode: true
  set include_erts: false
end
environment :prod do
  set include_erts: true
  set include_src: false
end

# You may define one or more releases in this file.
# If you have not set a default release, or selected one
# when running `mix release`, the first release in the file
# will be used by default
release :myapp do
  set version: current_version(:myapp)
end

# You can release umbrella apps individually, using the above format,
# or as a single release, using the following form, where you give
# the umbrella release a name, a version, and then add the umbrella
# applications you want to include in the release.
release :myumbrella do
  set version: "1.0.0"
  set applications: [
    :umbrella_app1,
    :umbrella_app2
  ]
end
```

Please see the module docs for `Mix.Releases.Config` for specifics on the
`environment/2`, `release/2`, `set/1`, and other macros.

## Release settings

The following is a list of config options specific to releases


```
- version (string);
    Required. The version of this release.
    Use `current_version/1` to load the current version
    of an application instead of hardcoding it.
- applications (list of atom | atom: start_type);
    Optional. A list of applications which should be
    included in the release. By default, the list will
    contain required apps, and apps discovered by walking
    the tree of dependencies. In umbrella apps, you must
    provide this setting, as it is not possible to know
    which applications should be included. You can also
    specify the start type of an application by providing
    the application and start type as a tuple. Valid start
    types are `:load`, `:permanent`, `:temporary` and `:transient`.
    See http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html,
    section 8.9 for details on these values.
```

## Environment/Release settings

The following is a full list of config options for both releases
and environments.


```
- dev_mode (boolean);
    symlink compiled files into the release, rather than copy them.
    this allows you to recompile and the release will be automatically
    updated. Use only for development.
- code_paths (list of strings);
    a list of additional code paths to use when searching
    for applications/modules
- vm_args (string);
    a path to a custom vm.args file
- config (string);
    a path to a custom config.exs file, this will be used when generating
    the sys.config for the release
- sys_config (string);
    a path to a custom sys.config file, this will be used in place of generating
    a sys.config, and thus will result in the config setting being ignored, choose
    one or the other as needed
- include_erts (boolean | string);
    whether to include the system ERTS or not,
    a path to an alternative ERTS can also be provided
- include_src (boolean);
    should source code be included in the release
- include_system_libs (boolean | string);
    should system libs be included in the release,
    a path to system libs to be included can also be provided
- strip_debug_info (boolean);
    should debugging info be stripped from BEAM files in the release
    CAUTION: This setting will result in releases which cannot
    be hot upgraded. Only use this if you need it.
- erl_opts (string);
    a string of Erlang VM options to be passed along to erl
- commands (keyword list of names to paths);
    Commands are extensions to the boot script which will run like any
    other boot script command, i.e. foreground, and are implemented
    as shell scripts, which will be copied into the release when it is built,
    just like boot script hooks.
- overrides (keyword list of app names to paths);
    During development its often the case that you want to substitute the app
    that you are working on for a 'production' version of an app. You can
    explicitly tell Mix to override all versions of an app that you specify
    with an app in an arbitrary directory. Mix will then symlink that app
    into the release in place of the specified app. Be aware though that Mix
    will check your app for consistency so it should be a normal OTP app and
    already be built.
- overlay_vars (keyword list);
    A keyword list of bindings to use in overlays
- overlays (special keyword list);
    A list of overlay operations to perform against the release, prior to archival,
    such as copying files, symlinking files, etc.
  - copy: {from_path, to_path} (copy a file)
  - link: {from_path, to_path} (symlink a file)
  - mkdir: path (ensure a path exists)
  - template: {template_path, output_path} (generate a file from a template)
- pre_start_hook (path);
    A path to a shell script which will be executed prior to starting a release
- post_start_hook (path);
    A path to a shell script which will be executed after starting a release
- pre_stop_hook (path);
    A path to a shell script which will be executed prior to stopping a release
- post_stop_hook (path);
    A path to a shell script which will be executed after stopping a release
- pre_start_hooks (path);
    A path to a directory with hooks which will be executed prior to starting a
release
- post_start_hooks (path);
    A path to a directory with hooks which will be executed after starting a
release
- pre_stop_hooks (path);
    A path to a directory with hooks which will be executed prior to stopping a release
- post_stop_hooks (path);
    A path to a directory with hooks which will be executed after stopping a release
